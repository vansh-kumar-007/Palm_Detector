# Palm Detector Project

## Overview

The Palm Detector Project is a Python-based application designed to detect and recognize human palms in images and video streams. Utilizing computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide accurate and real-time palm detection for various applications, including gesture recognition, augmented reality, and user interaction.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Detects palms in live video streams.
- **Image Processing**: Processes static images to identify palm regions.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs state-of-the-art machine learning models for reliable detection.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify and extend for specific use cases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (or PyTorch, depending on the model used)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow matplotlib
